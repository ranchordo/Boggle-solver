# Boggle-solver
 Super fast recursive boggle solver.  
 Edit the board size in BoggleBoard.SIZE.  
 Edit the smallest word in Main.SMALLEST_WORD.  
 filter\_list.py can filter from words\_orig.txt to words.txt. It removes words less than 3 letters long, and removes words that contain 'q' without a 'u' after it.  
 Board states can either be entered  
 ```
 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy
 ```
 or  
 ```
 abcde
 fghij
 klmno
 pqrst
 uvwxy
 ```
 Use a 'q' to insert a 'qu' block.
